# epson-matrix-printer-scripts
Heavily inspired by [this post](https://aschmelyun.com/blog/getting-my-daily-news-from-a-dot-matrix-printer/), I bought myself a dot matrix printer, an Epson RX-80 F/T from the 1980's.

This repo contains scripts for compiling a set of Markdown formatted files into a dossier to be printed. Special characters are converted to the character set that the printer supports. The current weather is fetched and converted into a grid that fits the paper.
